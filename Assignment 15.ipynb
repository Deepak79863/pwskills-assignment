    "Difference Sql and NoSql:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns. They use a standardized query language, SQL, to manipulate and retrieve data. SQL databases are ideal for structured data with well-defined relationships between different data points. Some examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a more flexible way. They can handle unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, and they do not require a fixed schema or data model. NoSQL databases use different data models, such as key-value, document, graph, or column-family. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j."
