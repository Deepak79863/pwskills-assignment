    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is designed for high availability, scalability, and performance, and is commonly used for web, mobile, and IoT applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are database management systems that do not use the traditional relational database model that SQL databases use. Instead, NoSQL databases use different data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, or graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for high scalability, agility, and flexibility in handling large, unstructured or semi-structured data. This makes NoSQL databases a good choice for use cases such as web analytics, content management systems, real-time data processing, and IoT applications.\n",

It is commonly used for use cases such as e-commerce, content management, mobile applications, and real-time analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some specific advantages of MongoDB over SQL databases include its ability to handle unstructured and semi-structured data, its flexible schema, its horizontal scalability, and its support for sharding and replication. Additionally, MongoDB's query language is more similar to modern programming languages, which makes it easier for developers to work with.\n"

    "\n",
    "High availability and scalability: MongoDB offers high availability and scalability through features such as automatic sharding, replication, and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich query language: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports a wide range of queries, including ad hoc queries, range queries, and full-text search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB provides a range of indexing options, including single-field, compound, and multi-key indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: MongoDB offers a flexible aggregation framework that allows developers to perform advanced data processing and analysis, such as grouping, sorting, and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS: MongoDB offers GridFS, a file storage system that allows developers to store and retrieve large files, such as images and videos, as part of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions: MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing developers to perform complex operations that span multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: MongoDB offers a range of security features, such as access control, authentication, and encryption, to ensure the security and integrity of the data stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
