    "1 Ans ) Python Classes:- A class is considered as a blueprint of objects. We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.\n",

    "Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity with attributes and behaviors that are defined by the class. An object has a state and a behavior, and it is created from a class. An object is also known as an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's consider a class called \"Car\". A Car class might have attributes such as color, make, model, and year, and behaviors such as start, stop, and drive ans these are objects of class,"

    "These four pillars are Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.\n",

    "Inheritance : Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism : Polymorphism is a programming term that refers to the use of the same function name, but with different signatures, for multiple types.\n",
    "Example of in-built polymorphic functions:\n",
    "Python program for demonstrating the in-built poly-morphic functions  len() function is used for a string print (len(\"Javatpoint\"))  \n",
    "len() function is used for a list  \n",
    "print (len([110, 210, 130, 321])).\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation : Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction : Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.\n",

    "3 Ans) The init() function is used in object-oriented programming to initialize the attributes of an object at the time of its creation. It is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created from a class. The init() method is also known as a constructor.\n",

    "Inheritance : Inheritance in python programming is the concept of deriving a new class from an existing class. Using the concept of inheritance we can inherit the properties of the existing class to our new class. The new derived class is called the child class and the existing class is called the parent class. Hierarchical inheritance in python, Multilevel inheritance in python including Single and Multiple inheritances are the types of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Single inheritance: When child class is derived from only one parent class. This is called single inheritance. The example we did below is the example for single inheritance in python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Brands:           \n",
