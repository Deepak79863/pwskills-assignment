    "Imperative Programming: This involves using statements to specify a sequence of actions that the computer should perform.\n",

    "16 Ans) Ans: Yes, indentation is required in Python. Indentation is used to indicate the block of code associated with control structures such as loops and conditional statements. The indentation level determines the scope of the code block, and a consistent indentation style makes the code easier to read and understand. In Python, the indentation level is defined by one or more spaces at the beginning of a line. The recommended indentation level is 4 spaces, but some developers prefer 2 spaces or use tabs instead of spaces. It's important to be consistent within a single project, and most code editors can automatically handle indentation for you."
